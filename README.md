<image src="./Minesweerp_SS.jpeg">
This is a classic Minesweeper game created using Python and the tkinter library. It's a simple yet challenging game where the player must uncover all non-mine cells to win. Be careful not to click on a mine!

**Note: This game is optimized for Windows. The mouse click index may differ on macOS.**

## How to Play

- Left-click on a cell to reveal it.
- If the revealed cell has no adjacent mines, it will automatically reveal its surrounding cells.
- Right-click on a cell to flag it as a potential mine.
- The goal is to reveal all non-mine cells without clicking on any mines.

## Rules

- The game grid consists of a 12x12 board.
- The game starts with 24 cells containing mines. The number of mines is configured to be approximately 1/6th of the total cells.
- If you click on a cell with a mine, you lose the game.
- The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed.
